# Capital City Memorizer

## About
Inspired by Memrise (the website which taught me every capital city in one week), this is a web-app designed to help the user to memorise the capital cities across the world. From the menu, the user can select which continent they'd like to start with, and then can choose between flashcards, a multiple choice game or a type game. 

In flashcard view, each country is listed on it's own card which can be clicked to reveal the it's capital. Multiple choice is a level up, and requires the user to select the correct answer from a shuffled and random choice of three. In the type game, the user must correctly type the answer or press 'pass' to move onto the next question. 

As of yet, data is hard-coded and front-end only, though this is likely to change in the future, at which point a user sign-up feature will also be added.
